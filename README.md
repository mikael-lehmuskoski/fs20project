# Bulletin ⁠— a Full Stack Open 2020 project

## Description

  This project is my entry for the Full Stack Open 2020 -course hosted by the University of Helsinki. The project's working title is 'Bulletin'. Bulletin is a dynamic and user-configurable cloud-based browser Start Page that aggregates information from different sources (listed below) into a functional and nice-to-look-at service. The service allows users to access their personal configured Bulletin and stored notes from multiple devices. The project will consist of a Node backend and a user-interface written in React. Expect to see some of the following frameworks and assorted things in Bulletin: Express, Apollo (GraphQL), Mongoose (MongoDB), Redux maybe, some UI framework probably

Current plans for the app components include the following:
* Initial components
    * weather service
    * RSS reader
    * built-in note app
    * world time / meeting planner
* If time permits
    * public transport timetables
    * webhooks for social media, instant messengers, git repo stats etc
* All components should be configurable for user's locale etc.
* Notes component is not meant for storing nuclear missile launch codes or other extremely sensitive information
* Details are subject to change as design finalizes.
